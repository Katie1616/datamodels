# Redis
## https://redis.io/

Redis is an open-source data structure store. It was named Redis, which means Remote Dictionary Server. It was released in 2009 and written in C, but it has many binding languages. Redis is not a relational database. It is a key-value database and NoSQL. 

# Key-value Databases

A key-value database is different than a relational database. It uses a key to retrieve a value. These keys and values can be any data type. The users don't describe the data they are trying to obtain but provide the key to acquiring the value. Key-value databases became much more popular during the 2010s when the NoSQL movement gained steam.
