# Elasticsearch 
## https://www.elastic.co/

Elasticsearch is a full-text search database that was written in Java. It was originally open source, but in recent years has changed. The data is semi-structured and for larger volume sets. Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database meant for much more complex searches. Java, Python, and several other coding languages can be used.
