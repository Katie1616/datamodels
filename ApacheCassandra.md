# Apache Cassandra 
## https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html

Apache Cassandra is a NoSQL, non-relational database. It was written in Java and is open-source, although being developed for larger tech companies such as Google and Facebook. Because this database doesn't use SQL, it creates CQL, which stands for Cassandra Query Language. It can be used in C++, Java, and Python. The data model for this is a wide column store which is a mix between a key-value and tabular database.
