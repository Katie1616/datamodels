DBase is a database management system that was released in 1979. It meets certain definitions of "relational" but not Codd's. It has open-source fonts and features but is commercial. It's implemented in C and used for applications that would benefit from a simple format. DBase products began to shift toward SQL and Windows operating systems since they were created so early they were forced to modify and grow. DBase was the most successful DBMS for microcomputers when it was first made.
